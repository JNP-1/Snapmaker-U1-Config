# Snapmaker U1 Config
This configuration has been extensively tested on my U1.

No problems have arisen. Tool changes have always worked reliably.

However, this does not mean that problems cannot occur on other printers.

I therefore emphasize that use is at your own risk and I accept no responsibility for any damage!

This configuration optimizes the TMC settings for the integrated XY stepper motors and uses higher speeds and accelerations for tool changes.

Requirements:
1. The tool positions must be exactly correct.
2. The belt tension must be correct.
3. The printer calibration process must be completed.
4. Tool changes must work without problems beforehand.

My test setup:

Printer: U1 from Kickstarter campaign (without top cover)
Firmware: 1.0.0 + v1.0.0-paxx12-10 (extended)
Slicer: Snapmaker OrcaSlicer 2.1.5
